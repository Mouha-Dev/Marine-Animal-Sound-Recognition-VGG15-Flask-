# Marine-Animal-Sound-Recognition-VGG15-Flask-
This project uses a deep learning model based on the **VGG15** architecture to classify and recognize different species of marine animals (such as whales, dolphins, etc.) from their vocalizations. (reconnaissance_audio_animaux_marrins(1).py)
A simple web application built with **Flask** is also included to allow testing the trained model by uploading an audio file. (Flask)
